The WordPress content management system powers over 40% of the web. And the WordPress user base and developer network isn't limited to Englishâ€“WordPress is global software supporting a variety of languages, and its internationalization features allow developers to configure their code so they can be easily translated for any locale. In this course, Carrie Dils introduces the specific functions and tools WordPress developers can use to make their code translatable to any language. Join Carrie as she shows how to work with various translation functions in WordPress, how to make themes and plugins translatable,
and even generate language files. Plus, if you know another language, find out how you can help the entire WordPress community by contributing to the WordPress translation project on GlotPress, an open-source platform used to translate WordPress.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
